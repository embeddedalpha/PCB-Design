# Auxiliary Power Board

<h4> 
This board is a daughterboard of a IIoT Data Acquistion Board. The board rectifies one 18V AC and one 12V AC power input and regulates them to produce clean 16-17V DC and 11-12V DC power. The board also supplies 5V DC power to main control board and also provide connectors to control high power relays so that they are isolated from sensitive devices
